# Project-Assignment-1
For those of you not familiar with Pacman, it's a game where Pacman (the yellow circle with a mouth in the above figure) moves around in a maze and tries to eat as many food pellets (the small white dots) as possible, while avoiding the ghosts (the other two agents with eyes in the above figure). If Pacman eats all the food in a maze, it wins.

In this project, the Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. I implemented general search algorithms such as depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms which are used to solve navigation problems in the Pacman world.
