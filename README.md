# Project-Assignment-1
In this project, the Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. We implemented general search algorithms such as depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms which are used to solve navigation problems in the Pacman world.
